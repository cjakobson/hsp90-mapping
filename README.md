# hsp90-mapping
 code to reproduce analysis and figures from Hsp90 manuscript

 # mapping
 Functions and example Snakemake file for Hsp90-dependent mapping as well as linear mapping in no radicicol (Hsp90 active) and radicicol (Hsp90 inhibited) conditions only.

 # plotting
 plotting_master_script.m will generate the figures in the manuscript. Specify your local code_directory, desired output_directory for the figure files, and download the dependencies (below) and specify the dependency_directory to run the script.

 # dependencies
 The mapping and plotting code depends on various input data that can be found here: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/0bx04fxbmzdm2tx63o2im/ACqBYF9kjZCe0DyLybhnJzU?rlkey=49cj84huufa5b2j7ikvamgigf&dl=0

 Upon acceptance, a final snapshot of the dependencies to reproduce the final figures will be available on Zenodo.
